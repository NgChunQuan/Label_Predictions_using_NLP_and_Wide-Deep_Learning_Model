Internship Project

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze unstructured text and applies a Wide & Deep learning model â€” a combination of TF-IDF vectorization (Wide) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Simple Recurrent Neural Network (SimpleRNN) (Deep) to predict classification labels.
