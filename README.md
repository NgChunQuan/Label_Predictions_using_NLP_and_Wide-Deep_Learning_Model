Internship Project

This project utilises Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique to analyze unstructured text and train a Wide & Deep learning model, a combination of TF-IDF vectorisation (Wide) with either Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Simple Recurrent Neural Network (SimpleRNN) (Deep), to predict classification labels.
